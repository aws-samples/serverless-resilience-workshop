# Serverless Resilience Workshop

## Overview

The following series of workshops will walk you through the process of creating a Chaos experiment to test the resiliency of your Serverless architecture.  You will establish the steady state of your application, perturb the application by injecting faults into the environment, and then observe how the application responds to the turbulence.  You will then apply corrections to your architecture to allow it to better perform in turbulent conditions.
