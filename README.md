# Serverless Resilience Workshop - Source Code

> Note: This source code is intended to be used as part of the lab materials
hosted at [https://resilience.workshop.aws](https://resilience.workshop.aws).

## Overview

The Serverless Resilience Workshop is a series of workshops that walk you
through the process of creating a Chaos experiment to test the resiliency of
a Serverless architecture. During the workshop you establish the steady state
of the application, perturb the application by injecting faults into the
environment, and then observe how the application responds to the turbulence.
You then apply corrections to your architecture to allow it to better perform
in turbulent conditions.

This repository contains the source code which implements, deploys, and
applies load to the application used in the workshop. This source code is
written with intentional errors and is for illustration purposes only. The
code is shared to be used as part of a series of workshops that walk you
through the process of creating a Chaos experiment to test the resiliency of
a Serverless architecture.
